<h3 id="toc_4">Technical Lead Engineer, Passive Logic - User Software - Autonomy Studio</h3>

    <p>Remote | March 2024 - Present</p>

    <p>As Technical Lead of the Autonomous Systems team, I collaborate with stakeholders to ensure efficient software feature releases and uphold high development standards. I work closely with the product, backend, and core models teams to eliminate ambiguity from our backlog, ensuring user stories and acceptance criteria are clearly defined, tickets are well understood, and accurate estimates are provided for prioritization.</p>

    <p>Key Contributions:</p>

    <ul>
    <li><p>Backlog Management: Collaborated with the product, backend, and core models teams to ensure clear and accurate backlog items, enhancing prioritization and execution.</p></li>
    <li><p>Retrospective Implementation: Introduced a quarterly retrospective cadence using the “4-Ls” framework, improving coordination and design standards.</p></li>
    <li><p>Mentorship: Mentored junior team members through pair programming, accelerating development, reducing code review duration, and sharing best practices.</p></li>
    <li><p>Performance Optimization: Enhanced frontend application performance by 4x on edge devices, resulting in a smoother user experience and reduced heat output.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>This integrated approach has facilitated efficient execution of software releases while maintaining a high standard of development practices within the team.</p>


    <h3 id="toc_5">Technical Lead Engineer, Zulily - Shopping Experience - Core Services</h3>

<p>Seattle, WA | February 2020 - December 2023</p>

<ul>
    <li><p>Lead the technical strategy and oversaw a team of engineers developing scalable services and backend systems for a major e-commerce platform.  I optimized my team by identifying opportunities to streamline, pair, swarm and align our services catalog with stakeholders which led to reduced on-call pages, clearer service boundaries and reduction of overall load upon our team.</p></li>
    <li><p>Orchestrated the transition of legacy systems to cloud-based architecture, significantly reducing system complexity and improving scalability.  Converted a continuously polling ECS cluster job into an S3 Event driven lambda consumer which reduced the number of empty receives from &gt;1M / day to &lt;1k.  Configured several &#39;spiky&#39; services as load-based auto-scaling groups which reduced our Ec2 cloud spend by 20%.  Lead adoption of structured logging standards across the org, swapping in a logging model which enabled teams to quickly filter pre-defined reports based on their services and migrate to a new analytics service provider DataDog from Splunk.</p></li>
    <li><p>Defined and assessed Engineering Proposals to fulfill product requirements and system modifications (upgrades, redesigns).  Worked across organizations to identify and assign resources for projects.  Teams understood their roles in a service while maintaining proper logic / data ownership - reducing &#39;who is responsible for this?&#39; thrash when patches were required.  <!--Ask me more about core services team became the source of truth and how I helped to un-wire that.--></p></li>
    <li><p>Drove operational excellence in the organization by leading weekly Ops-review discussions and analysis, raising ops reviews to the top priority for stand-ups and identifying code owners&#39; monitoring responsibilities in a monolithic repository.  Worked with teams to tag logs and metrics appropriately to ensure the correct team is ready to respond to issues and has the proper run-books to address faults or incoming support tickets.  On call pages reduced from 100+ / week to under 10.</p></li>
    <li><p>Mentored junior team members across the shopping experience organization through engineering design reviews, code reviews and identifying growth opportunities while scheduling and prioritizing upcoming sprints.  Delegated aspects of projects to team members based on their interest and experiences so the right person would benefit from the work or the work timeline could be optimized.</p></li>
